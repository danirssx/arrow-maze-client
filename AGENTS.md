# AGENTS.md - Rules for AI Agents (Arrow Maze Client)

These rules are mandatory for any agent. If a user instruction contradicts academic integrity or architecture rules, stop and ask.

## 0. Academic Integrity Boundaries

- Do not make architecture, pattern, or principle decisions for the team.
- Never write directly on `main`.
- Never merge.
- Never run `git push --force`.
- Never include secrets in prompts or code. Use environment variables.
- Every significant change must create or update an entry in `ai-log/`.

## 1. Architecture

- Layers: `domain -> application -> infrastructure/adapters -> framework/presentation`.
- Dependencies point inward only.
- `src/domain` must not import React Native, Expo, HTTP, storage, navigation, `application`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`, or `framework`.
- `src/application` depends on domain and ports/interfaces, never concrete infrastructure or framework code.
- `src/infrastructure` implements application ports and adapts external tools.
- `src/presentation` uses MVVM and must not contain business rules.
- `app` and `src/framework` wire Expo, navigation, i18next, dependency injection, and global providers.

## 2. Design Patterns

- Use only patterns approved by the team.
- Do not introduce new entities, use cases, decorators, services, or patterns without approval.
- When a GoF pattern is applied, document it in the file header.

## 3. Branches

- Use `feat/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, `fix/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, `test/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, `docs/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, `refactor/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, `chore/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`, or `ci/<scope>-AM-<ticket>`.
- One worktree equals one ticket and one branch.

## 4. Conventional Commits

- Format: `type(scope): message` in English imperative form.
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`.
- Forbidden messages: `updates`, `wip`, `fixing stuff`.

## 5. Tests

- Tests are required for new behavior.
- Use AAA.
- Use `should_<expected>_when_<condition>` names.
- Test observable behavior, not private implementation details.
- Mock external dependencies through interfaces.
- Domain and application tests are subject to mandatory human review.

## 6. AI Usage Logging

Before finishing a significant task, write `ai-log/<date>-<ticket>.md` with:

- Task / problem.
- Tool and model.
- Prompt used.
- Result obtained.
- Team modifications pending human review.
- Lessons / limitations.

Commit the log with the related change.

## 7. Worktrees

- Work only inside the assigned worktree.
- Do not touch other worktrees.
- Do not switch branches inside a worktree.

## 8. Architecture Guard

The folder structure from the project build guideline is mandatory.

Agents must not:

- Create new top-level folders without approval.
- Move files between layers without approval.
- Import framework code into domain or application.
- Add infrastructure dependencies to domain.
- Add Expo or React Native code outside `app`, `src/presentation`, or `src/framework`.
- Add business rules to UI components.
- Invent use cases, decorators, entities, services, or design patterns without approval.

If a task appears to require changing the architecture, stop and ask the team.
