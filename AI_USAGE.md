# AI Usage Log: Project Setup

## Task / Problem

Create the initial client repository configuration and governance scaffolding based on the project build guideline.

## Tool and Model

Codex / GPT-5.

## Prompt Used

The user asked Codex to build the project setup following `Build Completo del proyecto.md`, `Config de Agentes completa.md`, and the documentation guidance, with emphasis on configuration, build, agents, Zed, and Git worktrees.

## Result Obtained

Generated initial Expo/TypeScript configuration, Clean Architecture folders, lint/typecheck/test scripts, GitHub Actions, Husky/Commitlint, AI usage templates, PR template, agent prompts, and worktree scripts.

## Team Modifications Pending Human Review

- Review dependency versions before freezing the baseline branch.
- Confirm whether optional client tools such as AsyncStorage, SQLite, Axios, or Expo AV should be added.
- Complete human modifications after reviewing this setup.

## Lessons / Limitations

The setup intentionally avoids domain entities, use cases, decorators, and game patterns because those require team approval under `AGENTS.md`.
